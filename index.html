                        <h3>3D Survival Game</h3>
                        <p>In this collaborative project, my primary focus was on procedural generation and optimization to enhance both gameplay and performance. I developed the system responsible for procedurally generating the terrain and desert buildings, creating a dynamic and immersive environment. Additionally, I implemented procedural generation for the interior layouts of buildings, ensuring varied and engaging exploration experiences for players. To support smooth gameplay, I worked on optimizing the terrain rendering, significantly reducing performance bottlenecks and delivering a seamless and visually appealing experience.</p>

                        <p>In this 2D game centered around ocean conservation, players embark on multiple quests aimed at cleaning the sea and saving marine life. As part of a collaborative team effort, I contributed significantly to the design and development of the first two quests, laying the groundwork for the game's narrative and environmental goals. Additionally, I worked on enhancing the game's atmosphere by implementing environmental effects, including a dynamic parallax background to create a sense of depth, realistic wave animations, and immersive sound design to bring the underwater world to life. I also developed the mechanic where the water darkens as players swim deeper, intensifying the experience and adding a layer of immersion.</p>
